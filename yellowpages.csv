"Decision Making is an important part of the everyday lives of individuals and organizations. Many works within Computer Science have focused on supporting this process, especially by developing decision-supporting systems. We argue that for providing better support to Decision Making, it is paramount to understand the nature of a decision and of the process that leads to it. To accomplish that, in this paper, we go forward with our preliminary work in proposing a core ontology on Decision Making. Aiming at creating a wellfounded ontology, we rely on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), and we reuse some notions of existing ontologies on Value Proposition and Economic Preference. Besides describing the ontology, this work discusses some possible applications and compare our ontology with related works";"Core Ontology on Decision Making";"Renata Guizzardi,Bruno Guimarães Carneiro,Daniele Porello,Giancarlo Guizzardi";"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2728/paper1.pdf"
"The issue of recommending an appropriate piece of information has become essential for the news portals. In this context, a well founded ontological layer represents actually an indispensable artifact to suggest relevant news for the readers. However, news agencies still need to mine their data in order to discover valuable knowledge. In this paper, we present a prototypal automatic semantic annotator for the regional Brazilian newspaper called A Tribuna. Founded on a set of inductive algorithms allowing to classify newspapers in Portuguese and extract named entities from them, our approach describes the standardized categorization and the semantic matching with DBpedia, the socalled nucleus of the Linked Open Data Cloud. We discuss the limitation of our prototype and draw some challenging perspectives to face them. Finally, our proposal paves the way to a new kind of recommendation-based systems.";"A Prototypical Semantic Annotator for A Tribuna Newspaper";"Elias de Oliveira, Wesley Silva,Juliana P. C.

"In the construction of geological models, it is crucial to specify the spatial relations between the represented entities, which support the understanding of the 3D distribution of the rock bodies. In this paper, we propose an ontological model, based on the GeoCore ontology and the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which defines a set of spatial relations between geological objects, amounts of earth materials, sites, boundaries, and other geological entities. We discuss a modeling case study of a deep-water channel-levee occurrence of the Karoo basin data from South Africa. The result of this work is an ontology that supports software applications in the determination of the physically possible spatial distribution of reservoir geological bodies";"A Spatial Relation Ontology for Deep-Water Depositional System Description in Geology";"Fernando Cicconeto, Lucas Valadares Vieira, Mara Abel, Renata dos Santos Alvarenga, Joel Luis Carbonera";http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2728/paper3.pdf
"In software or program ontologies described in the literature, the separation between abstract and implementation views is evident. On the other hand, the ontological entities involved in such views are not very well defined in the context of programs life-cycle, having as parts conception, construction plan, construction process and verification. In many papers the ontological entities described are not very well grounded and they are only assumed as premises without top ontological background. To provide answers to some raised questions, this paper presents a computer program ontology based on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and an interpretation of such an ontology. The ontology and its interpretation show how a computer program ontology is complex and need to advance to attend some theoretical or practical needs.";"An Ontological Analysis From Algorithm to Computer Capability";"José Parente de Oliveira";"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2728/paper4.pdf"

"There has been an increase use of Domain-Specific Visual Modeling Language (DSVML) as a means of improving models’ comprehensibility and, consequently, stakeholders’ productivity. Combining the benefits of DSVMLs and of an ontological approach for designing and evaluating DSVMLs, we present, in this paper, the first-steps towards an ontology-based DSVML in the legal domain called LawV. The main purpose of LawV is to provide for a visual symbolic representation for legal statements. LawV has been built by applying an ontology-based language engineering method called PoNTO-S and UFO-L, a legal core ontology. To evaluate LawV, we instantiate a judicial case selected from the database of Appeal Court of the Espírito Santo State in Brazil.";"LawV: Towards an Ontology-Based Visual Modeling Language in the Legal Domain";"Cristine Griffo, Maria Das Graças Da Silva Teixeira, João Paulo Andrade Almeida, Frederik Gailly, Giancarlo Guizzardi"; "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2728/paper6.pdf"

"Literature surveys reveal several methodologies for building ontologies. A common step among all of them is the use of editors for organizing and formalizing knowledge. For researchers and students in Information Science, as well as for domain experts, the use of such editors is still an obstacle, because their majors does not favor the learning of relevant notions for the ontology development. Within this context, we have developed Onto4AllEditor, a graphical ontology editor, incorporated into a methodology, Web-oriented, which aims to provide functionalities for creating lightweight ontologies.

"Weathering is an event that changes rocks and sediments when they are exposed to the Earth’s surface conditions. This paper presents an ontological analysis and proposes a model for this type of event, based on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specializing concepts from the GeoCore ontology. The proposed model details the two main types of weathering processes (i.e. Physical Weathering and Chemical Weathering) and describes them in terms of transitions between situations, detailing the involved continuants and the properties that are affected, as well as how they are arranged in the situations connected by such processes. With this structure, the result of this work can help in tracing the past states of sediment and rocks before they are transformed into a weathering event and helps modelers to understand how to model physical occurents.";"Ontological Analysis of Weathering";"Lucas Vieira, Fabricio Rodrigues, Mara Abel";"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2728/paper10.pdf"

"One of the main challenges in building a domain ontology is to define what are the set of relevant terms to formally define and include in the conceptual model. The goal is that the selected terms provide good coverage on the required view over the domain and represent the common shared knowledge. In this work, we combine the examination of a technical thesaurus with a corpus of scientific papers of the domain to define a set of relevant geological terms as the first step towards developing a domain ontology for Petroleum Geology. To support the decision of which terms from the thesaurus we should analyze and model first, we ranked the terms on the corpus according to an adaptation of the TF-IDF statistic. After that, domain experts analyzed the top-ranked terms and selected only those that are continuants, related to Petroleum Geology. Finally, for each term chosen by the experts, we classified them as a specialization of the GeoCore Ontology or the BFO top ontology and elaborated an Aristotelian definition";"What Geologists Talk About: Towards a Frequency-Based Ontological Analysis of Petroleum Domain Terms";"Luan Fonseca Garcia, Fabrício H.

To reach an accurate model for this domain and provide a decision support, it is necessary to use modeling techniques that contribute to high semantic expressiveness, such as ontological analysis based on foundational ontologies. This work presents a rich and real example that illustrates how useful the application of ontological analysis can be in coping with such complexity.

The weather forecast information is provided by several systems with different formats, parameters and with a large number of heterogeneous concepts used in different organizations. To minimize this problem, the number of these heterogeneous concepts must be reduced in order to provide uniform access for better decision making.

"Comma-Separated Values (CSV) is used due to its low computational cost, on the other hand it is necessary to integrate it with a high-level repository to aggregate value to the data. In addition, Linked Data (LD) brought a new approach to enrich data and generate knowledge. Institutions in the most diverse areas can extract more knowledge from the data when it is coated in a semantic format. Each semantic tool has different features that directly impact the integration of LD from CSV. Hence, it is a recurring problem to know if the tool has all the features required for an integration project. This work proposes an objective evaluation of the features present in the tools that perform the semantic integration of data in CSV. The classification uses the features created in the literature in a new structure with their grouping. The salient features in the classification form the comparative framework that uses a positive number line facilitating the evaluation of the tools. The classification and framework can be used in all areas where there is semantic integration of data.
